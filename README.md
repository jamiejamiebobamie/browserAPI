Chosen Web API: Canvas

"The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing."

-https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API

Three Features:
        1.) Drawing (Spray Paint Can)
        2.) Animation (Ghost)
        3.) Drawing Text (Win-Lose Status)

The Canvas API has a host of features for enabling the visualization of graphics.

There seems to be no limit to the uses of this API and what it can do, from rendering videos and pictures,
to manipulating photos, to creating graphics for data visualization.

In my opinion it is a great API and very beginner friendly with lots of documentation online. (See above link.)

To run my site, please download the repo and open the index.html in any web browser. Some features of Canvas are only accessible with certain web browsers (namely Mozilla Firefox), but my site should run in any modern web browser.
